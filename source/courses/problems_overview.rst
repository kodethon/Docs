Problem Types
================

We currently support three types of problems:

    1. Diff
    2. Custom
    3. Multiple Choice

Diff

A diff problem is comprised of test cases. For each test case, you can specify:
    
    1. Standard input
    2. Arguments
    3. Expected answer
    4. Comment

When a student submits their program for grading, Kodethon will **generate a test script** based on the problem settings and test cases. 
For example, if you set standard input to be 'abc' and arguments '1 2 3' for **Test Case 1**, then the generated test command will look like:

::
    
    run main.py 1 2 3 < 1 

The specified standard input 'abc' will be written into a file called '1' and redirected into the student's program.

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

When a diff problem is created, we will generate the scaffold below inside the assignment files.

.. code-block:: yaml

    .submissions/
    test-name/
        ADDITIONAL_TEST_FILE(s)
        src/
        test/
        .submissions/
        .snapshots/
        .answers/
        .inputs/
        .arguments/
        .utils/
        .ref/
 
- test-name/ADDITIONAL_TEST_FILE(s)
    Adding additonal test files is completely optional. 

- src/
    The src folder should contain the files you expect your users to have.

- test/
    The test folder can optionally contain a test submission that can be used to test grading.

- .submissions/
    The submissions folder is where a student's latest submission will be stored. 
    Inside each submission folder will be the submitted files along with an output file with your test script's output.

- .snapshots/
    The snapshots folder is where all student submissions are stored. 

- test-name/.answers/
    The folder where answer files are stored after being added in the test cases.

- test-name/.inputs/
    The folder where stdin files are stored after being added in the test cases.

- test-name/.arguments/
    The folder where argument files are stored after being added in the test cases.

- test-name/.utils/
    Where utility files are stored. This folder should not be modified.

- test-name/.ref/
    If you choose to use a reference program, the uploaded file(s) will be stored here

Custom

You also have the option of providing an **On Start Command** that will be run when the student views or copies the assignment.
This setting can be used to generate **Dynamic Problems**; please read this section for more details.

Structure
^^^^^^^^^

A custom problem allows you to upload a zip file containing relevant test files. 
When a custom problem is created, we will generate the scaffold below inside the assignment files.

.. code-block:: yaml

    test-name/
        YOUR_TEST_FILE(s)
        src/
        test/
        .submissions/
        .snapshots/
 
- test-name/YOUR_TEST_FILE(s)
    The test script file can be any type of file that should be invoked within the command section in the config.yml       

- src/
    The src folder should contain the files you expect your users to have. It must contain a file called README.

- test/
    The test folder can optionally contain a test submission that can be used to test grading.

- .submissions/
    The submissions folder is where a student's latest submission will be stored. 
    Inside each submission folder will be the submitted files along with an output file with your test script's output.

- .snapshots/
    The snapshots folder is where all student submissions are stored.
