Description
===========

Custom problems allows the instructor to have full **control** on what to do when the student submits files for grading. 
Please be aware that the specified test command will be run as the Linux user **nobody**. Extra caution should be made
to ensure that proper read and write permissions have been set prior to student submission.

Structure
=========

When the student submits their files for grading, Kodethon will place their submission in the *submission* folder. The specified
test command will then be executed from within the autograder folder. That is, references to the student submission files should be made 
via *../submission/FILE_NAME*

Metadata.json
=============

The file will be of JSON format as shown below:
