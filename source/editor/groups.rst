Groups
*******************

Description
-------------------

Creating a group allows members to add their projects into a consolidated location. 
A group can also be hosted to provide custom environments to its members 
(See Custom Environments).

Permissions
--------------------

Projects in a group will retain their permission; this means that
if permission for read, write or execute is enabled for collaborators but
the respective permission is disabled for everyone, members in your 
group still have the authorization to perform the action.

An exception to this rule is that admins and the owner of the group 
will be able to view a project regardless of its read permissions. 

Owner
---------------------

The owner of a group has the ability to add and remove a project, remove the group,
change the name, description and password of the group, and assign admins. 

Admin
----------------------

An admin within the group has the ability to add and remove a project.

User
----------------------

An user within the group has the ability to add a project and remove only his or her projects.
