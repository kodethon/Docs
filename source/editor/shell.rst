Description
-------------

The CDE Shell is a command-line interface to Kodethon that supports 
basic UNIX commands that output and take input. The shell also supports unique commands 
such as 'generate' and 'embed' to perform Kodethon specific tasks. To see a list of available
commands, type 'help' in the terminal.
