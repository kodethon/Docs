Overview
-------------------

    1. A project can be created from the 'New' button. 
    2. Files in a project are separate from your personal account.
    3. Environments which you use to run your files are separate from your personal account.
        - For example, if you ran 'sudo apt-get update' in a project, those changes will not be reflected in your personal account.
    4. Projects have a slightly different set of apps available
    5. Edits to a project can be viewed in real-time
